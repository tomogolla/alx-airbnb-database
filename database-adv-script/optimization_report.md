#### Output:

| Table   | Access Type | Index Used             | Rows Scanned | Notes                 |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| `property (p)` | ALL         | None                   | 8            | Full table scan       |
| `booking (b)`  | ref         | idx_booking_property   | 1            | Indexed lookup         |
| `user (u)`     | eq_ref      | PRIMARY                | 1            | Primary key lookup    |
| `payment (pay)`| ref         | booking_id             | 1            | Indexed lookup       |

### Inefficiency Identified

####  `property` table: `type = ALL`
- This means **MySQL is scanning every row** in the `property` table.
- No index is selected, despite `"PRIMARY, idx_property_id"` being listed under possible keys.

**Why it's suboptimal:** Full table scans hurt performance when the table grows larger.

---

### Where It's Performing Well

- `booking`, `user`, and `payment` use indexes correctly (`ref` or `eq_ref`).
- These are efficient and scale well.

---

### Suggestions to Optimize

1. **Check `idx_property_id` definition:**
   - Ensure it matches `booking.property_id = property.property_id`.
   - Make sure it’s a regular index (not just a partial or irrelevant one).

2. **Force index usage (optional for tuning):**
   ```sql
   SELECT ...
   FROM property USE INDEX (idx_property_id)
   JOIN booking ...
   ```

3. **Consider composite indexes if filtering or sorting is added later.**

4. **Run `ANALYZE TABLE property;`**
   - Helps MySQL update index statistics so it can make smarter decisions.

5. **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (if MySQL 8.0+)**:
   - It shows actual execution time and row counts for deeper insight.

### Original Query Recap
When joining:

- `booking` → base table
- `user` → required (who made the booking)
- `property` → required (which was booked)
- `payment` → optional (`LEFT JOIN`)

It is observed that `property` was being scanned fully (`type = ALL`), suggesting indexing or join strategy improvements are needed.

---

### Refactored Query (Performance-Oriented)
```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at,

    u.first_name AS user_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount

FROM booking b
STRAIGHT_JOIN user u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
STRAIGHT_JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

---

### Key Improvements

| Strategy | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| `STRAIGHT_JOIN` | Forces MySQL to process `booking` first, avoiding inefficient join order guesses |
| Select fewer columns | Only needed fields to reduce memory usage and sort overhead |
| Explicit aliasing | Keeps columns readable and avoids ambiguity |
| Indexed foreign keys | Make sure these are indexed: `booking.user_id`, `booking.property_id`, `payment.booking_id` |

---

### Indexing extra
Run these statements to enforce index coverage:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON payment(booking_id);
```

If `property` table still shows `type = ALL`, consider:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_property_id ON property(property_id);
```
