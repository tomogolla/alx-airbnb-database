### Inefficiency Identified

####  `property` table: `type = ALL`
- This means **MySQL is scanning every row** in the `property` table.
- No index is selected, despite `"PRIMARY, idx_property_id"` being listed under possible keys.

**Why it's suboptimal:** Full table scans hurt performance when the table grows larger.

---

### Where It's Performing Well

- `booking`, `user`, and `payment` use indexes correctly (`ref` or `eq_ref`).
- These are efficient and scale well.

---

### Suggestions to Optimize

1. **Check `idx_property_id` definition:**
   - Ensure it matches `booking.property_id = property.property_id`.
   - Make sure itâ€™s a regular index (not just a partial or irrelevant one).

2. **Force index usage (optional for tuning):**
   ```sql
   SELECT ...
   FROM property USE INDEX (idx_property_id)
   JOIN booking ...
   ```

3. **Consider composite indexes if filtering or sorting is added later.**

4. **Run `ANALYZE TABLE property;`**
   - Helps MySQL update index statistics so it can make smarter decisions.

5. **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (if MySQL 8.0+)**:
   - It shows actual execution time and row counts for deeper insight.
